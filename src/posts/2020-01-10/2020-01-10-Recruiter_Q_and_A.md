##  Am I permitted to store PII data about you in our systems?

- Yes. Any data you get from my website is publicly available and therefore you are
    welcome to copy it into your candidate tracking systems. 

##  Can you share a little more about you?

- Certainly. See [my website](pascalbrokmeier.de) which contains my posts, CV, links to LinkedIn and some personal notes. 

##  What is your desired role?

- I currently see myself as a **senior engineer** with the tendency towards **architectural responsibility**. I'm also happy to lead teams in a technical context. I have been described as a **creative character with lots of ideas**. I thrive in the exploratory phase of a project, finding solutions to hard problems and drawing out how to get to the goal. I work well with a complementing character who takes a vision and works towards the realization of it. While I have a proven ability to deliver, my core strength is the problem solving phase.

##  What is your current and desired salary?

- I will discuss this individually.

##  Why are you looking to switch?

- I am **not searching for opportunities. But I am open** to the world. Life always changes. If there is something that excites me, I'm happy to work towards being part of this. Whether this is within the context of my current firm (Data Minded) or as an independent will have to be discussed. I would prefer keeping my ties to DM because it's a great team and I constantly learn from my colleagues here. 

##  Can you email me your CV?

- No but I can give you a link. It is [here](https://pascalbrokmeier.de/about/)

##  Do you have a PDF version of it? My clients prefer a file that I can send them. Are you sure you don't have this in word or as a PDF?

- No. I'm not looking for jobs so I won't keep a PDF version up-to-date. If you client cannot deal with a web link, that's unfortunate.

##  When can we set up a call today?


- I won't respond to "I have a (mysterious) position in mind, when can we call today" type of messages. Please only contact me for concrete projects. 


##  Do you have any questions for me?

Yes!

- What industry does your client operate in?
- What is the scope of the project? 
- Who is driving the project? Does it have executive backing?
- How big is the team?
- What technologies are required? Limit it to 3 so I know what is at the core of the activity
- Why does the client need external expertise? 
- How long is the current planning horizon? How many months will I be needed for if an agreement is found?
