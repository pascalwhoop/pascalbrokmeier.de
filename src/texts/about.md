I am a <span id="age"></span> years old engineer living in Brussels, Belgium. I
emigrated from Germany in 2018, initially working for *Space Applications Services* on
an ISS planning project but quickly switched fields to work as a Data Engineer and
Google Cloud Specialist for *Data Minded*. During the covid lockdown of 2020 I decided
to join McKinsey Digital to get a more global exposure and to see how business is done
on a global stage.

<!--
Before, I worked 6 years in software engineering in Germany and Australia. So far, I have lived
in 5 countries across three continents. That used to be something special but now I meet
people every day who can only smile at that.

My main concern is working on something that feels worth working for. My master thesis
was on future energy markets. Exploring the challenges of energy supply in a
hopefully sustainable future. Admittedly, In the past I found it rather difficult to find a
technical project that is both technically interesting _and_ tries to solve a problem
worth solving.

Looking at tech, I am a _Professional Data Engineer_ and _Cloud Architect_ for the
Google Cloud Platform.  In the past, my focus was mainly on (full-stack) web
technologies as well as IoT tech, backend and cloud infrastructure. I also have a bit of
a passion for IT privacy and security.  Currently, I mostly work with Kubernetes, AWS,
terraform and BigData tech like Spark and Kafka. According to some colleagues I'm also
pretty fun to watch interacting with my shell. Over the years I built some skills that
helped me minimize my keystrokes for most interactions with my machine, removing the
barriers between my idea and the execution.

I find data science and ML fascinating but have to compromise and work with specialists
in those fields instead of trying to learn it all on my own as well. As a Data Engineer,
I am capable of talking to and understanding the needs of Data Scientists and discuss
potential causes for model performance issues.  In a brief period in 2017/18, I dove
into machine learning by applying reinforcement learning to trading systems. 

From a social perspective, I have volunteered a number of years in the [Erasmus Student
Network](https://esn.org/about), where I was appointed as the National Partnership
Manager for Germany. In winter 19/20 I volunteered at [Hack Your Future
Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) as a coach, teaching web-development and general
SWE skills to refugees. 

In my free time I enjoy a number of podcasts and books (see [reading
list](http://pascalbrokmeier.de/reading/)) as well as water and mountain sports and
exploring cities, people and cultures. For the day-to-day, I recently got a road bike
which I enjoy as well.
