I am a <span id="age"></span> years old techie from Cologne, Germany and I recently moved
to Belgium, initially working for an ISS project at Space Apps but not as a Data
Engineer with Data Minded. Before, I have worked 6 years in software consulting and as a
freelance software engineer in Germany and Australia. I have lived in 4 countries across
three continents. That used to be something special but now I meet people every day who
can only smile at that. The world has gotten small!

My main concern is working on something that feels worth working for. My master thesis
was on future energy markets, helping to tackle the problems of energy supply in a
hopefully sustainable future. In 2019, I joined a small group of bright engineers to be
able to push my engagement for *meaningful* projects over the next years by bringing the
right data to the right people so we make the right choices. 

In the past, my focus was mainly on (full-stack) web technologies as well as IoT tech,
backend and cloud infrastructure. In 2017, I shifted my main focus to machine
learning by applying reinforcement learning to trading systems. Nowadays I also work a
lot with docker, kubernetes, cloud infrastructure and BigData tech like Spark and Kafka.

From a social perspective, I have volunteered a number of years in the [Erasmus Student
Network](https://esn.org/about), where I was appointed as the National Partnership
Manager for Germany.

In my free time I enjoy a number of podcasts and books (see [reading
list](http://pascalbrokmeier.de/reading/)) as well as water sports and exploring
cities, people and cultures. I am also a bit of a tech geek, playing around with
Raspberry Pi's, streaming [on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEn3QF8VlZzw0Se19GRAo6g) and
participating in Open Source development.
