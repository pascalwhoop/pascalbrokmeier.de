I am a <span id="age"></span> years old techie from Cologne, Germany and I recently moved
to Belgium, initially working for an ISS project at _Space Applications Services_ but now as a Data
Engineer with Data Minded. Before, I worked 6 years in software consulting (part-time) and as a
freelance software engineer in Germany and Australia. I have lived in 5 countries across
three continents. That used to be something special but now I meet people every day who
can only smile at that. The world has gotten small!

My main concern is working on something that feels worth working for. My master thesis
was on future energy markets, helping to tackle the problems of energy supply in a
hopefully sustainable future. In 2019, I joined a small group of bright engineers to be
able to push my engagement for *meaningful* projects over the next years by bringing the
right data to the right people so they make better decisions. I also recently completed both the professional Data Engineer and Cloud Architect certifications for the Google Cloud Platform.

In the past, my focus was mainly on (full-stack) web technologies as well as IoT tech,
backend and cloud infrastructure. I also have a bit of a passion for IT privacy and security, 
which is why I often spend weekends hacking on my Pi or phone, both of which are heavily modded. 
This is a hobby I often condemn but I just can't seem to pull myself away from it. It's just too 
much fun.

In 2017/18, I dove into machine learning by applying reinforcement learning to trading systems. 
Nowadays I also work a lot with kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, terraform and BigData tech like Spark and Kafka.

From a social perspective, I have volunteered a number of years in the [Erasmus Student
Network](https://esn.org/about), where I was appointed as the National Partnership
Manager for Germany. In autumn '19 I started volunteering at [Hack Your Future Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) as a coach, teaching web-development and general SWE skills to refugees. 

In my free time I enjoy a number of podcasts and books (see [reading
list](http://pascalbrokmeier.de/reading/)) as well as water sports and exploring
cities, people and cultures. For the day-to-day, I recently got a road bike which I learned to enjoy as well.
